done Hidden Arcologies
•	Negate all conditions that affect the surface (temp, meteors…)
•	Increase defence
•	Decrease all output by 2
•   Decrease Pop Growth
•	Two types for planets:
    o	Underwater Arcologies
    o	Underground Arcologies

Rural Polity
•	Farming provides luxury goods and supplies
•	Farming output +
•	Pop growth +
•	Industrial Industries massively reduce growth, stab and get high upkeep
•   "rural" industries increase growth stab and get - upkeep
•	Less likely to be targeted by inspections
•	Less likely to be targeted by raids
•	Requires farmland lv. 3 or temperate to be available

Monastic Orders
•	-50% positive income
•	No luddic cells
•	Stability can’t fall below 3 or go above 7
•	Locked at size 4
•	Industrial Industries reduce stab and get +upkeep
•	Military industries -upkeep
•   Marines stored here passively gather experience
•	Randomly builds known frigates and destroyers, rarely cruisers (by hand with a special hullmod)
•	Collects tithe from traders travelling in the system to storage
•	Increases stability of other colonies in the system

Corporate Governance
•	More income means higher stability
•	Higher stability does not mean more income
•	1.2x standard income multiplier
•	2 months max. disruption time
•	All industry slots immediately available when locked
•	negative base growth
•	base stability = 0
•	Incentives are twice as expensive (or more?)
•	Can shrink

done Underworld Governance
x •	Less stability = more income
x •	Increased illegal commodity outputs
x •	Increased fleet size
nah •	Raids other places at low stability (twice a year?) – like a free privateer port

Outpost
•	Income locked at +10k
    o	-80% upkeep cost to structures
•	No industry slots
•	6 Locked structure slots (place blockers)
•	Locked at size 3
•	Stability cannot fall below 5
•	No invasions
•	No luddic cells
•	No inspections

Resort planet (this one is uuuh cause I have no ideas)
•	Increases growth of other colonies in the system
•	Locked at size 5
•	No industrial buildings
•	No military
•	One industry slot
•	Negative income reduced by 80%
