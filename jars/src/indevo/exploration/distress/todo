event for a capital that dissolves into ghosts that fly away when you get close
event for a ship that despawns and becomes a pirate fleet when you get close
two fleets fighting, you can support either

I think I didn't port the vanishing ship thing properly, it's missing the rules

a capspammer with no logistics (or common sense) needs a high amount of fuel and supplies but will pay you well over market value for them
an heavily-dmodded Revenant phase freighter, the sole survivor of their science expedition that was ambushed by Remnants, offers to join your fleet
a tanker fleet offers you loads of fuel for a couple of supplies
inverse of the above
a small independent fleet with a few D-modded remnant ships has suffered an accident and needs supplies from the player; the player can choose to fight them for 100% drop rate remnant vessels, or provide the necessary supplies for a small sum of credits & indie rep
an indie fleet needs supplies and metals to complete some essential repairs after fending off a pirate attack, offers above market value in credits in return, as well as some indie rep
a lone prom captain has gone insane from being stuck in the outer reaches of the sector for years by themselves after losing their crew in a tragic accident, sets their ship to self destruct
    and tries to take the player with them (does the gate explosion effect from the main story, causes CR dmg to player fleet if they dont get out of there)
