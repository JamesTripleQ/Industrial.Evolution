IndEvo_JumpRift,CUSTOM,"A massive rip in the fabric of space leading to hyperspace. It was created by firing the Rift Generator, moving the planet that once stood here to a different star system.",,,
IndEvo_arsenalStation,CUSTOM,"An abandoned arsenal station, built to outlast whatever weapons a long dead enemy would have brought to bear. A cursory scan indicates that it has been cold and dead for tens of cycles at the very least, possibly hundreds. Closer inspection may yield salvage.",,,
IndEvo_orbitalLaboratory,CUSTOM,"An abandoned orbital laboratory. Stations like this were built to keep experimental tech away from prying eyes. A cursory scan indicates that it has been cold and dead for tens of cycles at the very least, possibly hundreds. Closer inspection may yield salvage.",,,
IndEvo_Watchtower,CUSTOM,"This automated remnant of old domain system defence transmits targetting data to nearby artillery. The encrypted target data is inaccessible to the controlling faction, and does not expose the actual position of the observed fleet.",,,
IndEvo_artilleryStation,CUSTOM,"A massive, domain-built strategic system defence weapon, this behemoth of forgotten technology can secure a large area all by itself. It operates semi-autonomously, comes with integrated nanoforges for ammunition, and will target any hostile entities that are spotted within range.",,,
IndEvo_Artillery_mortar,CUSTOM,"A massive, domain-built strategic system defence weapon, this behemoth of forgotten technology can secure a large area all by itself. It operates semi-autonomously, comes with integrated nanoforges for ammunition, and will target any hostile entities that are spotted within range.

The defence platform is armed with a mortar, bombarding targets with a high volume of explosive ordinance at extreme range.

Old safety protocols prohibit targeting of inhabited areas.",,,
IndEvo_Artillery_missile,CUSTOM,"A massive, domain-built strategic system defence weapon, this behemoth of forgotten technology can secure a large area all by itself. It operates semi-autonomously, comes with integrated nanoforges for ammunition, and will target any hostile entities that are spotted within range.

The defence platform is armed with a missile launcher, firing oversized long-range target seeking ECM missiles to interdict and slow hostiles.

Old safety protocols prohibit targeting of inhabited areas.",,,
IndEvo_Artillery_railgun,CUSTOM,"A massive, domain-built strategic system defence weapon, this behemoth of forgotten technology can secure a large area all by itself. It operates semi-autonomously, comes with integrated nanoforges for ammunition, and will target any hostile entities that are spotted within range.

The defence platform is armed with a railgun, firing multiple extremely fast projectiles at an long range.

Old safety protocols prohibit targeting of inhabited areas.",,,

IndEvo_parts,RESOURCE,"Old starship parts which can no longer be properly produced by the decaying Sector infrastructure. Their only reliable source is the deconstruction of existing ships. A shortage of these will not prohibit the construction of new ships by much, but it will seriously affect their quality.",,,
IndEvo_rare_parts,RESOURCE,"Ancient or highly advanced technology which can no longer be manufactured in the Persean Sector. These components are essential to building new, pristine spaceships - they do not get traded on the open market, and are the reason Salvage Yards are usually viciously guarded.",,,

#Weapons,,,,,
IndEvo_cryoartillery,WEAPON,"""We were able to replicate the weapon's core from a molecular scan and it appears to be functional, though we remain clueless as to how it actually operates. While it might well violently implode at any moment, we managed to hook it up to a pair of accelerator rails for now, and initial tests show it to be working at just above 2/3 of the originals measured output.""","- Engineering Log Excerpt, Project Snowblind",,
IndEvo_degrader,WEAPON,"""While the weapon has proven functional, the actual performance fell well below anticipated levels. For some reason it refuses to draw sufficient power before discharge and the project lead decided to leave it at that after one of the techs got disintegrated trying to find the cause. The new plan is to scale down the frame to just what is needed to hit the apparent draw cap.""","- Engineering Log Excerpt, Project Spitfire",,
IndEvo_causalitygun,WEAPON,"""So, the cascading energy fluctuations that have been plaguing us all week appear to have fixed themselves without us doing anything. The power supply guys said they had planned to make some adjustments later today, so it wasn't them either. With how little we know about the components we're working with, it wouldn't surprise me if it's just some weird moon phases.""","- Engineering Log Excerpt, Project Eureka",,
IndEvo_pulsedcarbine,WEAPON,"""Considering the catastrophic side effects of capacitor charge processes near the core unit, we have decided to shift to an entirely different system of simply supplying new capacitor units to the weapon with ammo feeders. This seems to avert the issues entirely so far, but there is no way we will ever be able to match the peak demands of the system this way.""","- Engineering Log Excerpt, Project Parallax",,
IndEvo_riftgun,WEAPON,"""Work with the blackbox device has proven dangerous, to say the least. We've had multiple cases of strange rifts appearing out of thin air while the device was under power before the regulator unit was installed, and someone lost a finger to one of them. Got lucky, if you ask me. We'll attempt to fit the focusing unit tomorrow, now that our measured output levels have stabilised in a weaponisable range, and I pray we get some good results before project lead gets pissy again.""","- Engineering Log Excerpt, Project Keyhole",,

IndEvo_mine_belt,TERRAIN,"A semi-autonomous, self replicating minefield, distributed in a ressource rich asteroid belt. Spent mines get replaced automatically, allowing the field to persist hundreds of years without loss of efficiency.",,,
IndEvo_mine_field,TERRAIN,"A semi-autonomous, self replicating minefield. Spent mines get replaced automatically, allowing the field to persist hundreds of years without loss of efficiency.",,,
IndEvo_slowfield,TERRAIN,A field composed of charged shrapnel and strange matter particles that disrupt drive field stability and cause slowdown. Fields like this are short-lived and were commonly used by domain strategic system defence missiles as payload.,,,
