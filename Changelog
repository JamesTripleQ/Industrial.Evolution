--------------------------- to do -----------------------------
todo consumable item that allows forced targetting of artillery on mouse pos

- steal that one illustration with the bunker for the arty?
- add roaming derelict fleets to uninhabited arty systems

- Add something that lets you remove S-Mods
- Change derelict industries to superstructures
- Artillery industry images

missiles are underwhelming in combat, increase overload dur
add sounds
add some more settings for minefields
add a reusable ship gacha (requires relic components) at a superstructure like hypershunt

--------------------------- known issues -----------------------------

Added - Behaviour: Deliver (Transports cargo to planet, delivers it into storage, then returns to your fleet)
DELIVER FLEETS REFUSE TO LEAVE SYSTEM AFTER DELIVERY; MAYBE MOVE INTO HYPERSPACE OR MANUALLY SET MOVE TARGET?

hey with the current IndEvo patch all my crew in the detachment are getting eaten up after a day has passed.
 The pattern is 1 full day after creating the detachment.
 So if I create the detachment half way through Feb 19th, the crew disappear when it turns Feb 21st.

ok so uh, one more issue if you arent aware, if you have a detachment stationed in another system, and you are in a different solar system
i dont think the detachment actually moves
